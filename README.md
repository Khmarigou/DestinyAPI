# Destiny API by Khmarigou
I'm a beginer with the bungie API. It's only a personnal project made in my free time.
The project architecture can be improved i know.

## Configuration

### libraries

```sh
pip install requests, json, requests, base64, webbrowser, datetime, configparser
```
(note that the tkinter GUI is not implemented yet as well as the sqlite DB)

### config file
1. Copy the `config.ini.example` in `config.ini` :
    ```sh
    cp config.ini.example config.ini
    ```

2. Use your values from the bungie website in `config.ini`.
